/**
 * `_$compose` is a type-level function that allows users to compose
 * multiple type-level functions together. It takes in a list of functions and a type argument as input,
 * composes the functions in its input list from right to left,
 * and applies the resulting type-level function to the second input type.
 *
 * @param {Kind.Kind[]} FX a tuple of type-level functions
 * @param X a type to which a `Kind` can be applied.
 *
 * @see {@link Kind._$pipe}
 * `Kind._$pipe` provides the same functionality as `_$compose` but evaluates the list of functions in reverse order.
 *
 * @see {@link $$}
 * In short, `$$` is an alias for `_$compose` where `FX` is reversed.
 * Refer to {@link $$} for examples.
 *
 * ## Errors
 *
 * `_$compose` ensures that the tuple of kinds is composable by enforcing that
 * the Nth type-level function's output is a subtype of the (N + 1)th input.
 * If this is not the case, `_$compose` will return the `never` type.
 *
 * @see {@link Kind.InputOf} {@link Kind.OutputOf}
 * If you receive a `never` type, it can be helpful to use the `Kind.InputOf`
 * and `Kind.OutputOf` type-level functions to inspect the input and output
 * types of the type-level functions that you are composing together.

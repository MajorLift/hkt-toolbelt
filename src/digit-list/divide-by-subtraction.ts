/**
 * `_$divideBySubtraction` is a type-level function that performs the division or modulo operation by subtraction.
 * It takes in two digit lists `A` and `B` representing the dividend and divisor respectively, and an operation type
 * which can be either "DIVIDE" or "MODULO". It returns the result of the operation (division or substraction).
 *
 * @template A - A digit list representing a number to divide.
 * @template B - A digit list representing a number to divide by.
 * @template OPERATION - A string type representing the operation to be performed. Can be either "DIVIDE" or "MODULO".
 *
 * @example
 * For example, we can use `_$divideBySubtraction` to divide a digit list representing the number 10 by 2:
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { DigitList } from "hkt-toolbelt";
 *
 * type Result = DigitList._$divideBySubtraction<["1", "0"], ["2"]>; // ["5"]
 * ```
 *
 * @example
 * We can also use `_$divideBySubtraction` to find the remainder when a digit list representing the number 123 is divided by 17:
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { DigitList } from "hkt-toolbelt";
 *
 * type Result = DigitList._$divideBySubtraction<["1", "2", "3"], ["1", "7"], "MODULO">; // ["4"]
